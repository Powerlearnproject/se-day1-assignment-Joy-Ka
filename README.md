#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

         Software engineering is a branch of engineering that focuses on design , development , testing and maintenance of software applications

                              Importance of Software Engineering  in the technology industry

    It enhances efficiency by streamlining processes, automates tasks , and reduces manual effort , leading to increased productivity and cost effectiveness across industries.

    Through software engineering we are able to create user-friendly digital solutions such as applications and thus enhancing overall user experiences

    It enables global connectivity. Software applications facilitate real-time communication  and collaboration globally , hence transforming  how  we interact and conduct businesses  

    Software engineering plays a crucial role in developing secure software systems that protect sensitive data and prevent cyber attacks.

    Software engineering is crucial for developing cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) , virtual reality and blockchain , which driving innovation in the tech 
    industry

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    1.)  The Birth of High-level programming Languages :
          In this era , high-level languages such as COBOL and FORTRAN  were developed .Before this, programming was done in low-level machine code or assembly language and thus tis 
          proved cumbersome and error prone. In contrast to low-level languages , high-level languages made programming more efficient and accessible allowing programmers to write code 
          that is easy to read , maintain ,understand  and debug.

    2.) The Emergence of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
          During this period , languages such as Java and C++ were introduced and these languages introduced new ways of managing and organizing code. OOP allowed for modular, reusable 
          and scalable code by encapsulating data and behaviours witin this paradigm.

    3.) Rise of Agile Development Methodologies
           Agile Development Methodology emphasized iterative development,collaboration and flexibility.Agile Methodology transformed how software is developed ,shifting the focus from 
           rigid planning and continuous improvement thus delivering faster software delivery and increased customer satisfaction.   

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    1.) Planning
          This phase involves identifying and gathhering the requirements required by the software, analyzing the budget , the period of time that would take to develop the software and 
          the constraints that might hinder the development of thhe software are identified in this phase. It is also in this phase that we are able to define the scope of cover of the 
          software.

    2.) Designing
         During this phase,the User Interface of the software is actually developed using tools such as figma, Entity Relational(ER)Diagrams are designed so as to represent the structure 
         of the system conceptually.

    3.) Development
         Actual development of the software is done here.It includes creating a back-end, a database and a user-friendly frontend wwhich the users will be interacting with.In the 
         development phase is where actual coding takes place.

    4.) Testing 
          Under the testing phase , we tend to fix the bugs found within the software program. Testing can be done by the use of debugging software and can also be done manually.

    5.) Deployment
          The Software is released and published to the public for consumption.But at this point , it is done through the use of changeover strategies.It is also at this stage,training 
          on how to use the new software is done.

    6.)Maintenance
          The software is maintained regularly by keeping it upto date and free from bugs.At this point , new features can be added to te software.     

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    Both the waterfall and agile methodologies do have a phased approach , whereby they break complex projects into smaller manageable tasks.In agile these are iterative cycles while in 
    the waterfall model the smaller manageable tasks tend to be in sequential phases.

    Agile methodology tends to have an iterative and incremental approach , whereby with each iteration, new features are added to the existing product.The agile methhodology tend to 
    heavily rely on user feedback and thhus making it flexible while the Waterfall methodology tends to have a sequential approach , where for one task to take place, the running task 
    should be completed first.Unlike the agile methodology  which is flexible,the waterfall model tends to be rigid and sequential.
    
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    
    The role of a sofware developer is to design the codes , tests and maintains software applications.The responsibilities of a Software developer is to write clean and efficient code , 
    integrating software components , troubleshooting and debugging and gathering user feedback for improvements.

    The role of the Quality Assuarance Enginner is to ensure software quality by identifying and resolving defects.The responsibilites of a Quality Assuarance Engineer are designing the 
    testing processes , identifying and documenting defects and collaborating withh developers to resolve issues.

    The role of a Project Manager is to oversee the entire project life cycle,, ensuring timely and budgeted completion.The responsibilities of a Project Manager are planning and exeuting 
    project plans , managing resources ,,timeliness and budgets and ensuring project standards and quality

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  
    Integrated development Environments (IDEs) streamline software development by providing tools for coding debugging and testing in one interface.They also offer features such as syntax 
    highlighting and autocomplete thus making it easier for developers to learn and work with code. An example of an IDE is visual studio code.

    Version control Systems (VCS) enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts and they provide a transparent audit trail of all the changes made in the 
    codebase.An example of a version control systems is the Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

     Due to Rapid technological advancements , it becomes difficult to keep up with the new technologies and tools and thus to solve this issue , the software engineer can dedicate time 
     to learning new technologies through courses ,blogs, articles and webinars.

     Effective team collaboration and communication can be a challenge to software enginners and thus to reslove this issue the software engineer should implement clear communication 
     channels,set expectations and use collaboration tools such as Zoom and Slack.

     Debugging complex systems and codebases tends to be a major problem to software engineers and thus to resolve on this problem they tend to utilise system debugging , peer reviews and 
     tools like npm can be utilised during debugging

     Software enginners at times might face unclear or changing software requirements and thus to resolve this problem, they can use agile methodologies or adapt to modular design or 
     involve the stakeholders during development so as to get their feedback.
     
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

     Unit testing focuses on verifying that individual units or components of the software function as expected.They are run early in the development cycle to catch bugs quickly.

     Intergration Testing evaluates how different modules or components of the software interact with each other. It ensures that when these modules are combined , they work seamlessly together.

     System Testing involves evaluating the entire software system to ensure it meets all the functional requirements.It stimulates real-world scenarios to validate that the system behaves as expected from start to finish.

     Acceptance user testing ensures that the software meets the business and user requirements. It validates whether the software is acceptable for delivery and use.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

        Prompt enginnering is the process of crafting,refining and optimizing inputs to guide generative AI models towards producing specific , high-quality outputs.

    Importance  of Prompt Engineering are as follows:

        Improved Output Quality: Well-crafted prompts ensure that AI-generated outputs are of high quality, reducing the need for manual revisions and post-processing. This is particularly 
        important in applications where accuracy and relevance are critical14.

        Versatility and Adaptability: Prompt engineering allows LLMs to adapt to new tasks and use cases, making them more versatile and efficient. This adaptability is crucial for 
        expanding the capabilities of AI models beyond their initial training data410.

        Mitigating Biases: Effective prompts can help mitigate biases in AI outputs by ensuring that the generated content is fair, equitable, and inclusive. This is achieved by carefully 
        structuring prompts to avoid biased language or assumptions2

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

     Vague Prompt:
        "Write something about technology."

    Improved Prompt:
       "Write a 300-word article explaining how artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare, focusing on its impact on diagnostics and patient care. Use clear examples and avoid overly technical jargon."

    Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
       Clarity: The improved prompt specifies the exact topic (AI in healthcare) and subtopics (diagnostics and patient care), eliminating ambiguity.

       Specificity: It provides a word count (300 words) and directs the writer to include examples, ensuring the response is detailed and actionable.

       Conciseness: The prompt is straightforward and avoids unnecessary information, making it easy to understand and follow.
